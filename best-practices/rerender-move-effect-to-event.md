## Put Interaction Logic in Event Handlers

If a side effect is triggered by a specific user action (submit, click, drag), run it in that event handler. Do not model the action as state + effect; it makes effects re-run on unrelated changes and can duplicate the action.

**Incorrect (event modeled as state + effect):**

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false)
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (submitted) {
      post('/api/register')
      showToast('Registered', theme)
    }
  }, [submitted, theme])

  return <button onClick={() => setSubmitted(true)}>Submit</button>
}
```

**Correct (do it in the handler):**

```tsx
function Form() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)

  function handleSubmit() {
    post('/api/register')
    showToast('Registered', theme)
  }

  return <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
}
```

If the logic must stay inside an effect but should not re-run when a value like `theme` changes (e.g. a "connected" notification), extract it into an Effect Event with `useEffectEvent` (React 19.2+).
